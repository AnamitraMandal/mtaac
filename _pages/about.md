## Objectives

- Formulate, test and evaluate methodologies for the automated analysis and machine translation of transliterated (i.e., transcribed sign-by-sign) cuneiform documents, and provide state-of-the-art technology to specialists in the field of Assyriology;

- Make available the translation of a specific and representative set of cuneiform documents to scholars in related disciplines and to a networked public (namely the Ur III corpus); 

- Provide new data for the study of the language, culture, history, economy and politics of the ancient Near East by harvesting the linguistic byproducts of the translation and information extraction processes;

- Formalize these new data utilizing Linked Open Data (LOD, including Linguistic LOD) vocabularies, and foster the practices of standardization, open data and LOD as integral to projects in digital humanities and computational philology.
